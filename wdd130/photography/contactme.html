        <p>Contact Me</p>
        <p>There are many ways you can contact me. You can reach me by my Instagram account; go ahead and dm me about anything you want to know. I can receive any texts and I will try to respond as soon as possible. Another way to get in contact with me would be with a phone call. I donâ€™t make any promises on answering one hundred percent of the time, but I will get back to you once I can. If you have any questions or concerns about what I can do, let me know and I will try answer back within a reasonable time. I am here for you, and I will make sure you get the best experience you can have with photoshoots.</p>
